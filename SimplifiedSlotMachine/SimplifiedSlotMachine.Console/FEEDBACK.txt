FEEDBACK +/- and FIXES

+ uses decimal for monetary amounts
+ UI abstracted
+ has tests

DONE - GameSession properties are manipulated from outside
DONE RANDOM- random and console not abstracted
DONE - win logic does not work if first symbol is wildcard
PROPOSED - no configuration, hard-coded size of slot and symbols
NO TIME NOW - no DI, interfaces not really used

and
(+) There is some input validation
(+) I/O is abstracted
(+) Session/PlayerBalance, Spin/Round and Game are different abstractions
(+) There are unit tests in the solution
(+) Testing probabilities are met


(~) Code is protected with inline checks but it's unnecessary at most places. It's causing clutter

DONE (-) Amounts are not rounded
DONE (-) RNG is odd. Instead of it being built better there are comments explaining why it's done that way
PROPOSED (-) Symbols are hard-coded
DONE (-) RNG is not abstracted
NO TIME NOW (-) No DI. Although there are interfaces, they are weirdly put in another project and not fully utilized
PROPOSED (-) Not configurable
NO TIME NOW (-) Mix use of DTO and DomainModel design
NO TIME NOW (-) There are unnecessary tests to the unnecessary exceptions
